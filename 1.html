            “Keep Ya Head Up” is a track off of 1993’s Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. It features the backing vocals of Dave Hollister.
            This song could easily be seen as Tupac’s tribute to all single mothers. Here are some of the lyrics in the beginning
            of the track: “Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice / I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the
            roots / I give a holler to my sisters on welfare / Tupac cares, if don’t nobody else care / I know they like to beat ya
            down a lot / when you come around the block brothas clown a lot /  but please don’t cry, dry your eyes, never let up /
            forgive but don’t forget, girl keep your head up.” His praise for women continues with the following: “I think it’s time
            to kill for our women / time to heal our women, be real to our women / and if we don’t we’ll have a race of babies / that
            will hate the ladies, that make the babies / and since a man can’t make one / he has no right to tell a woman when and
            where to create one / so will the real men get up?” He continues, “you can’t complain you was dealt this / hell of
            a hand, without a man, feelin’ helpless / because there’s too many things for you to deal with / dying inside, but
            outside you’re looking fearless.” He also makes mention of his gratitude towards his mother and the influence of
            Marvin Gaye; the chorus itself partially taken from Gaye’s song, “Ooh Child (Things Are Gonna Get Easier).”
