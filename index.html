          <h1>pac Shakur's 5 best lyrics/verses</h1>
          <p>When today’s up-and-coming hip-hop and
            rap artists think of their influences, surely Tupac (or 2Pac)
            Shakur comes to mind. In his career before his death in 1996,
            he created five studio albums; five albums of his material were
            released after his death, leading many to believe that the artist
            was still alive. Whatever you believe, Tupac left a lasting legacy.
            Despite his singing about violence, revenge and the infamous east
            coast/west coast rivalry, he also sang songs about serious issues and
            supporting women, inner city youth and black people overall. Here are
            five of Tupac Shakur’s best lyrics and verses.</p>
