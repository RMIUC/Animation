          <p>Essentially, this track, off of 1991’s 2Pacalpyse Now, is about young pregnancy (specifically at 12 years old) in the ghetto, how hard it is to raise a child and how often women turn to prostitution. The song tells a story, beginning with lyrics like, “I hear Brenda’s got a baby / but Brenda’s barely got a brain / a damn shame / the girl can hardly spell her name / (that’s not our problem, that’s up to Brenda’s family 0 / well let me show ya how it affects the whole community.” He then goes on to describe Brenda’s absent mother, her junky father and the father of her baby being her cousin. This is how her family treats the situation: “She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family / who didn’t really care to see, or give a damn if she / went out and had a church of kids / as long as when the check came they got first dibs.” The following lyrics describe vividly but simply what happens next: “He left her and she had the baby solo / she had it on the bathroom floor / and didn’t know so, she didn’t know / what to throw away and what to keep / she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heap / I guess she thought she’d get away / wouldn’t hear the cries / she didn’t realize / how much the little baby had her eyes.” The story continues with Brenda going back for her baby, but without support from family, she has no way to make a living, so she ends up a prostitute who in the end of the song, gets killed.</p>
