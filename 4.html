          <p>Using the melody and some of the chorus from Bruce Hornsby’s “The Way It Is,” “Changes” has become one of Tupac’s most popular songs. In the first ten lines or so, he manages to describe thoughts of suicide, wanting to steal because he’s hungry, how when cops kill a black person the cop is considered a “hero” and hints of how drugs and guns thrive among black youth culture because the government is allowing it to happen. He then shows a dash of hope within lyrics like, “I got love for my brother / but we can never go nowhere / unless we share with each other / we gotta start makin’ changes / learn to see me as a brother ‘stead of two distant strangers.” He then goes on to describe racism and how it affects black people, as well as rapping, “and although it seems heaven sent / we ain’t ready to see a black president.” Lastly, he talks about how there’s a war “in the streets,” “in the middle east” and a “war on drugs,” yet there’s no war on poverty; because of the color of his skin, he has no other choice but to be the stereotypical gangster, always having to watch his back in case someone he wronged in the past decides to get revenge. Essentially, he wants things to change, but he knows they probably won’t, and “that’s just the way it is.”</p>
